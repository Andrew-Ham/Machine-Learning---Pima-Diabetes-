<h3 align="center">Machine Learning - Pima Diabetes Prediction</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Built my first machine learning project in Python! I used the Machine Learning Workflow to process and transform Pima Indian data to create a prediction model to predict which people are likely to develop diabetes with > 70% accuracy.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Recently I have only being looking into fullstack development. However, I wanted to branch off to new ares of technology to broaden my knowledge and get new experiences.
<p> I was very intrigued about machine learning and started learning straight away! Being experienced in python was very useful!
